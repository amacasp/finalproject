# finalproject
I made some shitty code for my computer programming class as my final project.
 Feel free to modify it and tear it apart. Any tips for future coding will be greatly appreciated.
The music organizer and music player class was not made by me, it was precode provided to me by the class and school.
Credit also goes to Sergey Sardiko who helped me throughout the coding process
