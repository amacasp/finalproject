# finalproject
I made some code for my computer programming class as my final project.
Feel free to modify it and tear it apart. Any tips for future coding will be greatly appreciated.
Majority of the code was not made by me. It was simply a template that I modified.
Credit also goes to Sergey Sardiko who helped me throughout the coding process
